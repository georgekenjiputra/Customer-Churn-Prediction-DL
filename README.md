## Objective

The objective of the project is to develop an effective churn prediction model that helps businesses reduce customer churn. By analyzing various factors and utilizing deep learning techniques, the aim is to identify customers who are likely to leave a product or service. The project seeks to provide actionable insights and strategies for businesses to implement targeted retention efforts and increase customer loyalty. Ultimately, the goal is to minimize churn, enhance customer satisfaction, optimize resource allocation, and maximize revenue for the company.

## Conclusion

Churn, or customers leaving a product or service, presents challenges for businesses. Analyzing customer churn revealed that over half of the customers are at risk. Factors like gender, age, and region have minimal correlation with churn, while membership type and higher transaction values reduce churn risk. Tailored retention strategies and increased transaction values are key to reducing churn.

Using the recall metric, which measures true positive predictions, minimizing false negatives is crucial to avoid missed retention opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, wasted resources, lost revenue, and reputation damage. The models showed a good fit after improvement, with the Improved Functional API model chosen for its superior false negative filtering.

Deep learning models excel in handling complex data but require careful optimization. To improve churn prediction, focus on feature engineering, data preprocessing, experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, and continuous monitoring. Leveraging transfer learning and updating the model with new data also enhance performance and provide actionable insights.
